 * An RBI-Client does the following:
    Receive a 'server' IP as a command line parameter from args[0];
    Connect to the server ip given.
    Echo a 'Connection successful' message to the user.
    Accept a user command from the command line.
    Let's say the user enters 'ls /tmp'.
    You need to write the user command to the output stream of your connected socket.
